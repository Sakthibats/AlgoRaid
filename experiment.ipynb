    "# Trading Strategy Report: Arbitrage between USDC and USDT\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "### 1.1 Overview\n",
    "This report presents an arbitrage trading strategy that exploits the price deviations between two stablecoins, USDC and USDT, on the Binance exchange. The strategy aims to buy USDC when its price is below 1 USDT and sell it when the price exceeds 1 USDT, and vice versa. The backtest, conducted over one year of historical data, reveals that the strategy is profitable under specific market conditions, though it is sensitive to trading fees and slippage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "### 2.1 Background\n",
    "USDC and USDT are two of the most widely used stablecoins, each pegged to the US dollar. Despite their pegged nature, small price deviations can occur due to market demand, liquidity conditions, and arbitrage opportunities. This strategy seeks to capitalize on these deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Objective\n",
    "The objective of this strategy is to generate profit by exploiting small, temporary price deviations between USDC and USDT on the Binance exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "### 3.1 Data Collection\n",
    "Historical price data for the USDC/USDT trading pair was collected from the Binance API. The data spans from August 1, 2023, to August 1, 2024, with a 1-minute granularity. The data was cleaned and formatted for analysis, with close prices being the primary focus for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Strategy Description\n",
    "The strategy is based on a simple arbitrage logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Buy USDC when the price of USDC/USDT is below 1, indicating USDC is undervalued relative to USDT.\n",
    "Sell USDC when the price of USDC/USDT is above 1, indicating USDC is overvalued relative to USDT.\n",
    "The reverse applies for USDT, buying it when it is undervalued and selling when it is overvalued.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Implementation\n",
    "The strategy was implemented in Python using the Binance API for data retrieval. The backtest involved iterating over the historical data, executing buy and sell orders based on the strategy rules, and tracking the portfolio's value over time.\n"
